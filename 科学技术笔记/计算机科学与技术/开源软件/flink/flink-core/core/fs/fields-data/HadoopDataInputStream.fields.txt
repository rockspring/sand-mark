/**
 * Minimum amount of bytes to skip forward before we issue a seek instead of discarding read.
 *
 * <p>The current value is just a magic number. In the long run, this value could become configurable, but for now it
 * is a conservative, relatively small value that should bring safe improvements for small skips (e.g. in reading
 * meta data), that would hurt the most with frequent seeks.
 *
 * <p>The optimal value depends on the DFS implementation and configuration plus the underlying filesystem.
 * For now, this number is chosen "big enough" to provide improvements for smaller seeks, and "small enough" to
 * avoid disadvantages over real seeks. While the minimum should be the page size, a true optimum per system would
 * be the amounts of bytes the can be consumed sequentially within the seektime. Unfortunately, seektime is not
 * constant and devices, OS, and DFS potentially also use read buffers and read-ahead.
