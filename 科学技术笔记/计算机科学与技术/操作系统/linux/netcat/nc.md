### 启动一个服务器nc -l 8000

```
-l      Used to specify that nc should listen for an incoming connection rather than initiate a connection to a remote host.  It is an error to use this option in conjunction with the -p, -s, or -z options.  Additionally, any timeouts specified with the -w option are
             ignored.
